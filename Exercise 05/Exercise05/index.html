                <p><i>Problem with JND?</i>
                    <!-- Your answer... --> 
                    Although JND in CIELAB ensures that the color differences can be perceived by the human eye,
                    this is also influenced by different features of the visualization, like size, density of elements and surrounding colors.
                    Also, by definition, JND must be detectable at least half of the time, which could mean there could be
                    a large proportion of the audience not detecting it.  
                           </p>
                <p><i>Consequences?</i>
                    <!-- Your answer... --> 
                    The consequences of these drawbacks are that the visualization could be misinterpreted or hard for the viewers
                    to interpret. Important differences may not be noticeble and thus important information may be lost. 
                </p>
                <p><i>Solution?</i>
                    <!-- Your answer... --> 
                    To deal with the consequences, we could complement the color encoding with other cues 
                    such as size or patterns to make critical differences easily interpretable. We should 
                    ensure that the color ranges are large enough as to generate better contrast between adjacet colors. 
                    We could also test the visualization with a sample audience and then improve as needed.

                <p><i>Disadvantage of 12-class Set3</i><br>
                    Firstly, it is hard for viewers to grasp the main message of the visualization. 
                    With so many colors, important information might get lost, and viewers may struggle to identify significant patterns.
                    <br>Secondly, nearby regions that are closely related might appear disjointed due to the dissimilar colors, 
                    hindering viewers' understanding of their connections.
                    <br>Third, it is difficult for viewers to remember and associate each color with its corresponding category or meanings.<!-- Your answer... -->

            <li><b>c) </b><i>(10/15 points)</i>
                <p><i>Problem after cropping?</i><br>
                    We have limited the number of colors that not be sufficient to represent all the categories effectively.<br>
                    For RGB color space, equal numerical changes can result in very different perceptual changes.

                </p>
                <p><i>What would be a better approach?</i><br>
                    Choose colors that are visually distinct and provide good contrast.<br>
                    Colors should be perceptually uniform.

                </p>
                <p><i>Which colors would you choose?</i><br>
                    I selected circles with the most similar differences in CIELab values. Thay are the colors with index from 0 to 3.

        <h2>Task 2 (5 points)</h2>

                <p><i>Construct mapping rules?</i>
                    <!-- Your thoughts... -->
                    The first thought was to choose green for 100 and red for 0, since these colors would be easily associated with 
                    the light colors (red for stop, green for go). Nevertheless, it is very important that anyone could interpret the 
                    color, and red-green is problematic for color blind people. Also, it should not be a divergent color scheme, since
                    the middle value is not neutral, but actually corresponds to a sequential order. That's why we chose a beige and dark red.
                
                    We want the differences to be noticeble, so we used the interpolateLab function, which returns a CIELAB color space, 
                    making it perceptually uniform.

                    <!-- Your answer... -->
                    Lighter colors may no be so easily seen in traffic (they do not call the attention so much).
                    There's no previous associations with the colors and speed.

                    <!-- Your answer... -->
                    The scale is easily interpretable and sequential. It's easy for the viewers to remember the 
                    extreme values.                 
                     The colors chosen are also color-blind friendly.
